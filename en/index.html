            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <content>
                <p>
                    Playing a musical instrument such as the piano can seem quite difficult. 
                    We see the masters of this instrument naturally play complex pieces without mistakes, and we think how we could achieve something like that, mere mortals. 
                    Although mastering this instrument at that level takes a huge amount of hours of daily practice, it is possible to get to play very well, dedicating a reasonable time and only a few essential lessons to start playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this tutorial, you will be able to learn enough so that in a week you can <b>master the essentials</b> to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Locate the notes quickly on the keyboard</li>
                        <li>Learn some simple techniques of hand posture</li>
                        <li>Learn the most important elements of music theory</li>
                        <li>Make some simple musical accompaniments to your tunes</li>
                        <li>Read and play melodies from written music</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve this, you will need to dedicate at least one hour a day to this course: half an hour to acquire knowledge and another half hour to perform the practices. If you concentrate and devote your time well, you may even need less of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tutorial is organized so that <b>each day you can achieve something concrete</b>. 
                    If you follow the programming in this way, you will achieve your task in a week. 
                    Naturally, you can adapt the time you spend, but the most important thing is <b>consistency</b> in practice. The human body has a wonderful capacity to adapt to constant and repetitive actions, you will not be able to believe what you will achieve in such a short time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The knowledge and techniques that I share in this publication are based on years of experience teaching children, youth and adults. 
                    Most of them were very successful and they managed to learn, however, some of them did not achieve it, and it was not due to some disability, but simply because they did not dedicate adequate time to practice. 
                    I emphasize again that it is one of the most important factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, it is clear that what is taught in this tutorial is only a basic part of everything that could be learned to become a piano teacher. After you finish this course and you manage to play your first melodies, it is up to you to decide to continue with your learning and take it to the next level. You can choose to take private lessons, study formally, or simply resort to new lessons that you can find online. Everything depends on the dedication you want to give him. I wish you luck on this path. Now, get to work!

            <h2>Day 1: Hands on the job</h2>
            <content>
                <p>Objective: to know the instrument and quickly locate the keyboard notes.
                </p>

            <h3>1.1 Knowing the Piano</h3>
            <content>
                <p>
                    The piano is a relatively modern instrument. It is a stringed instrument, but unlike others like the guitar or the violin, the strings vibrate by percussion. Using the keyboard mechanically transmits a blow to the appropriate strings so that they resonate. Its main predecessors were the organs of tubes, passing through the stringed instruments like the Harpsichord or the Clavichord, of which inherits the structure of the current keyboard.
                </p>
                <h4>Keyboard organization</h4>
                <p>
                    The keyboard of a piano is formed by a pattern of black and white keys that repeat one or more times. This pattern contains seven white keys and 5 black keys: one group with <b>two</b> and another with <b>three</b> black keys.
                </p>
                <piano inline from="C" :length="5"></piano>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <piano inline from="F" :length="7"></piano>
                <p>
                    We will call this repetitive pattern an <b>octave</b>, and it contains all the notes of a musical scale. Each piano can have from one to several octaves. A conventional piano has 7 octaves.    
                </p>
                <piano :length="48" class="small">
                </piano>
                <blockquote>
                    How many octaves does this keyboard have?
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    When you play the notes of an octave, and compare them with another, you will see that the only difference in the sound is that the notes are higher as you move to the right. The first key of the group is C, and if you play from the first white key of the octave to the seventh, you will be playing the scale C-D-E-F-G-A-B. 
                </p>                                                                                                                                                               
                <piano from="F" :length="24" notes="C1,D1,E1,F1,G1,A1,B1" labels="" :show-labels="true"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Exercise: On the keyboard, touch the key sequence indicated above. 
                    <br>
                    <sample sequence="C,D,E,F,G,A,B">Listen</sample>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h4>The black keys</h4>
                <p>
                    The black keys constitute intermediate tones (half tones) between notes of the white keys.  
                </p>
                <piano :length="17" from="C" notes="" classes="transp,,transp,,transp,transp,,transp,,transp,,transp,transp,,transp,,transp"></piano> 
                <p>
                    You will notice that <b>there are no halftones</b> in parts of the octave. This will help us a lot to locate the notes on the keyboard (Later on we will talk about why).
                </p>
                <piano :length="17" from="C" notes="C1,E1,F1,B1,C2" classes="transp,,transp,,,,,transp,,transp,,,,,transp,,transp" ></piano>
                <blockquote>
                Exercise: Try to play a <b>sequence of random black notes</b>. What does it sound like?
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Central octave</h4>
                <p>
                    Normally, at the center (or near) of the keyboard is the central octave, which is where most of the melodies are played in the level that is compared to the human voice tone. On small keyboards, it is moved more to the right.
                </p>
                <piano :length="36" from="C" class="medium" notes="C2,D2,E2,F2,G2,A2,B2"></piano>

            <h3>1.2 Locating the notes on the piano</h3>
            <content>
                <h4>The most common mistake</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the most common mistakes made by those who want to learn to play the piano is to <b>label the keys</b> , that is, to place labels with the names of the notes (or even write them directly on the keys).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to learn to play and move faster, <b>you should not label the keys</b> . If your keyboard is already labeled, you should remove the labels or cover them with blank labels (especially if they are written with permanent ink).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is <b>critically important</b> , since you can not learn to place the notes naturally if they are labeled. Also, think that if you later want to play another piano that is not yours, you will not have the labels available to help you. I assure you there is a better method. You will <b>never need them</b> again, and <b>that will happen today</b> .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The method I use is based on association and visual recognition, that is, from today you will place the notes on the keyboard naturally by <b>direct recognition</b> , without the help of labels or sequences. Some key aspects about this method are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You do not need to make marks or labels on the keyboard (in fact, it is better not to have them)</li>
                        <li>The notes will be learned in a different order, not in the natural order (C-D-E-etc)</li>
                        <li>As additional notes are added, small revisions of the learned notes are made to reinforce previous associations</li>
                        <li>The results are better if after a while, on the same day, the learning sequence is completely reviewed again</li>
                        <li>Melodic exercises will be added to reinforce the associations and at the same time manage to play familiar melodies</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <blockquote>Before continuing, repeat after me: I promise from this moment that I will not use labels on my piano .</b>.</blockquote>

                <check >I promise!</check>

                <h4>C</h4>
                <p>
                    The first note that we will learn to locate will be the DO. It is the guide note of the musical scale and therefore the most important. We locate it on the keyboard at the <b>beginning of the group of two black keys</b>.
                </p>
                <piano :length="12" notes="C1" labels="C" classes=",,,,,transp,transp,transp,transp,transp,transp,transp"></piano>
                <sample sequence="C,C,C,C,C">Listen</sample>

                <p>
                    Applying this definition, we can now locate each C key in the keyboard, <b>at the beginning of each group of two black keys</b> . Note that even that last note of the following keyboard is also a C, since the pattern repeats itself again.
                </p>

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="C1,C2,C3,C4,C5"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Exercise: On the keyboard, touch all the C keys you find, as in the previous figure. Do it several times until you can play all the C keys without making a mistake.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    When you play the same DO in several different octaves, you will notice that the sound is the same, but more <b>acute</b> (high frequency) to the right and <b>lower</b> (low frequency) to the left.
                </p>

                <h4>F</h4>
                <p>
                    It's the F's turn. It is the following because it is similar to the C key: we locate it on the keyboard at the beginning of the group of three black keys.
                </p>
                <piano :length="12" labels=",,,,,F" notes="F1" classes="transp,transp,transp,transp,transp"></piano>
                <sample sequence="F,F,F,F,F">Listen</sample>

                <p>
                    Applying this new definition, we can locate all the F keys in the keyboard, <b>at the beginning of each group of three black keys</b> .
                </p>

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="F1,F2,F3,F4"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Exercise: On the keyboard, touch all the F keys you find, as in the previous figure. Do it several times until you can play all the F notes without making a mistake.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    It is possible that during the exercise you have confused the F key with the previously learned C key, which is at the beginning of the group of <b>two black keys</b>. Remember:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C</b> at the beginning of the group of <b>two</b> black keys</li>
                        <li><b>F</b> at the beginning of the group of <b>three</b> black keys</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Now the following exercise will mix both notes to recognize them together.
                </p>

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="C1,F1,C2,F2,C3,F3,C4,F4,C5"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Exercise: On the keyboard, touch all the C and F keys you find, as in the previous figure. Do it several times until you can play all the C and F notes without making a mistake.
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Review</h4>
                <p>
                    Now it's time to review C and F keys individually to reinforce.
                </p>

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="C1,C2,C3,C4,C5"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Excercise: On the keyboard, touch all the C keys you find, as in the previous figure. Do it several times until you can play all the C keys without making a mistake.

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="F1,F2,F3,F4"></piano>

                </blockquote>


                <h4>E</h4>
                <p>
                    Now we will move to E key. Its location on the keyboard is <b>at the end of the group of two black keys</b>.
                </p>
                <piano :length="12" labels=",,,,E" notes="E1" classes=",,,,,transp,transp,transp,transp,transp,transp,transp"></piano>
                <sample sequence="E,E,E,E,E">Listen</sample>

                <p>
                    Now, we can locate all the E keys on the keyboard, <b>at the end of each group of two black keys</b>. 
                </p>

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="E1,E2,E3,E4"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Exercise: On the keyboard, touch all the E keys you find, as in the previous figure. Do it several times until you can play all the E notes without making a mistake.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    It is possible that in this part you get confused with the key at the end of the group of three black keys, but it will pass.
                </p>
                
                <h4>B</h4>
                <p>
                    Now we jump to the B key. It is the following because it is similar to the E key: we place it on the keyboard <b>at the end of the group of three black keys</b>.
                </p>
                <piano :length="12" labels=",,,,,,,,,,,B" notes="B1" classes="transp,transp,transp,transp,transp"></piano>
                <sample sequence="B,B,B,B,B">Listen</sample>

                <p>
                    As in the other cases, we can locate all the B key in the keyboard, <b>at the end of each group of three black keys</b>.
                </p>

                <piano :length="49" class="small" notes="B1,B2,B3,B4"></piano>
                <blockquote>
                    Exercise: On the keyboard, touch all the B keys you find, as in the previous figure. Do it several times until you can play all the B notes without making a mistake. 
                    Also, be careful not to get confused with the E key which is located at the end of the group of two black keys.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    It is possible that during the exercise you confused the B key with the E learned in the previous one. Remember:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>E</b> at the <b>end</b> of the group of <b>two</b> black keys</li>
                        <li><b>B</b> at the <b>end</b> of the group of <b>three</b> black keys</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
